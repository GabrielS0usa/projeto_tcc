### 5. ✅ lib/screens/health_screen.dart
**Conflict Type**: Major - Two different implementations

**Resolution Strategy**: **MERGED BEST OF BOTH BRANCHES**

#### From HEAD Branch (Kept):
- ✅ Improved UI structure with labels on grid items
- ✅ Better code organization with helper methods
- ✅ `DetailPage` class for placeholder screens
- ✅ Grid item labels ("Bem-Estar", "Saúde", etc.)
- ✅ Better progress bar with gradient and animation
- ✅ `ColorUtils` integration for dynamic colors
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio (0.95) for grid items
- ✅ Box shadows for depth

#### From f449249 Branch (Integrated):
- ✅ `ApiService` integration for backend calls
- ✅ Real-time data fetching from API
- ✅ Periodic updates (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ User profile loading from `/user/profile`
- ✅ Progress tracking from `/user/progress/today`
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Loading states with proper indicators
- ✅ Navigation refresh after returning from detail pages

#### Key Merged Features:
```dart
// API Integration
final ApiService _apiService = ApiService();
Timer? _updateTimer;

// Periodic updates
_updateTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 30), (timer) {
  if (mounted && _selectedIndex == 0) {
    _fetchDashboardData();
  }
});

// Real data from API
Future<void> _fetchDashboardData() async {
  // Fetches user profile and progress from backend
  final profileResponse = await _apiService.get('/user/profile');
  final progressResponse = await _apiService.get('/user/progress/today');
  // Updates UI with real data
}

// UI Improvements with labels
_buildGridItem(
  icon: FontAwesomeIcons.faceSmile,
  label: 'Bem-Estar',  // ← Added from HEAD
  color: VivaBemColors.amareloDourado,
  // ...
)
```
