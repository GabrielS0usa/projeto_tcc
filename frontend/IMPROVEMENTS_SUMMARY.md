   - ✅ Clean, organized imports

2. **Converted to StatefulWidget**
   - ✅ Changed from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
   - ✅ Added proper state management with `_HealthScreenState`
   - ✅ Implemented `initState()` for initialization

3. **Added Data Models**
   - ✅ Created `UserProfile` model (`lib/models/user_profile.dart`)
   - ✅ Created `HealthMetrics` model (`lib/models/health_metrics.dart`)
   - ✅ Both models include mock data factories for testing
   - ✅ Both models support JSON serialization for future API integration

4. **Simplified Color Logic**
   - ✅ Created `ColorUtils` helper class (`lib/utils/color_utils.dart`)
   - ✅ Replaced complex inline color logic with clean helper methods
   - ✅ Methods: `getIconColor()`, `getAppBarContentColor()`, `getContrastingTextColor()`

5. **Made User Name Dynamic**
   - ✅ User name now comes from `UserProfile` model
   - ✅ Easy to integrate with authentication system later
   - ✅ Displays: `'Olá, ${_userProfile.name}!'`

6. **Made Progress Dynamic**
   - ✅ Progress now calculated from `HealthMetrics` model
   - ✅ Shows actual completion ratio (18/20)
   - ✅ Animated progress bar with gradient

### ✅ Medium Priority Enhancements (COMPLETED)

7. **Implemented Bottom Navigation**
   - ✅ Added `_selectedIndex` state tracking
   - ✅ Created `_onBottomNavTap()` handler
   - ✅ Navigation switches between Home, Stats, and Settings

   - ✅ Improved user understanding and accessibility

9. **Created Placeholder Screens**
   - ✅ `StatsScreen` - Statistics placeholder (`lib/screens/stats_screen.dart`)
   - ✅ `SettingsScreen` - Settings with sections (`lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`)
   - ✅ Both screens follow app design language
   - ✅ Professional "coming soon" messaging

10. **Enhanced Progress Bar**
    - ✅ Added "Tarefas de Saúde" label
    - ✅ Shows progress text in two places for clarity

## 🔄 Future Integration Points

### Ready for API Integration
- User profile can be loaded from authentication service
- Health metrics can be fetched from backend
- JSON serialization already implemented
- Easy to replace mock data with real API calls

### Extensibility
- Models support `copyWith()` for immutable updates
- Color utils can be extended with more functions
- Settings screen ready for actual functionality
- Stats screen ready for charts/graphs

## 🚀 How to Use

### Loading User Data
```dart
// Currently uses mock data
_userProfile = UserProfile.mock();
_healthMetrics = HealthMetrics.mock();

// Future: Replace with API call
_userProfile = await authService.getCurrentUser();
_healthMetrics = await healthService.getTodayMetrics();
```

### Updating Progress
```dart
// Update task completion
setState(() {
  _healthMetrics = _healthMetrics.updateTaskStatus('wellness_diary', true);
});
```

### Navigation
```dart
// Bottom navigation automatically handles screen switching
// No additional code needed
```
